    Yes, absolutely! You can cherry-pick a commit from a different worktree in Git.  In fact, worktrees are designed to share the underlying Git repository, so accessing commits from different worktrees is a core feature and very straightforward.

    Here's why and how it works:

    **Why it works:**

    * **Shared Git Repository:** All worktrees connected to the same repository share the same `.git` directory. This `.git` directory contains the entire commit history, branches, tags, and objects of your repository.
    * **Commits are Repository-Wide:** Commits are not tied to a specific worktree. They are part of the global Git repository history.
    * **`git cherry-pick` Operates on Commits:** `git cherry-pick` takes a commit hash (or a reference that resolves to a commit, like a branch name) as an argument. It doesn't care *where* that commit originated within the repository (which worktree it was created in).

    **How to cherry-pick from a different worktree:**

    1. **Identify the Commit:**
       * **In the other worktree:** Go to the worktree where the commit you want to cherry-pick exists. You can use `git log` or a Git GUI tool in that worktree to find the commit hash.
       * **From your current worktree:** If you know the branch or commit hash in the other worktree, you can also see it from your current worktree using commands like `git log --all --graph --decorate --oneline` (or similar log commands) and looking for the commit in the output. You might need to know the branch name in the other worktree to easily locate it.

    2. **Switch to Your Target Worktree (if you aren't already there):**
       ```bash
       git worktree switch <your-target-worktree-name>
       # Or if you prefer using directories:
       cd <path-to-your-target-worktree>
       ```
       This is the worktree where you want to apply the cherry-picked commit.

    3. **Use `git cherry-pick` with the Commit Hash:**
       ```bash
       git cherry-pick <commit-hash-from-other-worktree>
       ```
       Replace `<commit-hash-from-other-worktree>` with the actual commit hash you identified in step 1.

    **Example:**

    Let's say you have two worktrees:

    * **`main-worktree` (your main worktree)**
    * **`feature-worktree` (another worktree for feature development)**

    You made a commit in `feature-worktree` with the hash `abcdef1234567890` that you want to apply to your current branch in `main-worktree`.

    **Steps:**

    1. **Identify the commit hash:** You already know it's `abcdef1234567890`. (If you didn't, you would go to `feature-worktree` and use `git log` to find it).

    2. **Switch to `main-worktree`:**
       ```bash
       git worktree switch main-worktree
       # Or: cd <path-to-main-worktree>
       ```

    3. **Cherry-pick the commit:**
       ```bash
       git cherry-pick abcdef1234567890
       ```

    Git will now apply the changes from commit `abcdef1234567890` to your current branch in `main-worktree`.

    **In summary:**

    Cherry-picking between worktrees is seamless because worktrees are just different working directories for the *same* underlying Git repository.  You just need to know the commit hash you want to cherry-pick, and you can use `git cherry-pick` as usual from any worktree connected to that repository. You don't need to do anything special because you are working with worktrees.
