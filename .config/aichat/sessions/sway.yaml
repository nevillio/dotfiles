  content: I'm using sway as my window manager with Ubuntu 24.04 LTS. Sometimes I use terminal windows in scratchpads. So that I can temporarily access them without blocking the view. But this doesn't work very well with my main terminal window as I can't clearly distinguish between the main window and the scratchpad. What's the best way to address this issue? Should I just add a border property to the scratchpad if it's the terminal or is there an easy way to setup a floating terminal similar to a scratchpad?

    You have several good options to distinguish your main terminal from a scratchpad terminal in Sway:

    **1. Distinct Border for Scratchpad Terminals:**

    This is a simple and effective solution.  You can apply a specific border style and color only when the terminal is in a scratchpad.  Here's how you can do it in your Sway config:

    ```swayconfig
    for_window [app_id="Alacritty"] { # Replace Alacritty with your terminal's app_id
        set $term_border pixel 1 # Default border
        set $term_border_color #2e3440 # Default border color
    }

    for_window [app_id="Alacritty", scratchpad_state=visible] {
        set $term_border pixel 5
        set $term_border_color #bf4040  # A distinct red color
    }

    for_window [app_id="Alacritty", scratchpad_state=hidden] {
        set $term_border pixel 1
        set $term_border_color #2e3440
    }
    ```

    This config snippet does the following:

    * Sets a default thin border for your terminal (Alacritty in this example -  adapt it to your terminal).  Use `swaymsg -t get_tree` to find the `app_id` of your terminal.
    * When the terminal is in the scratchpad and visible, it sets a thicker, red border.
    * When the scratchpad is hidden, the border reverts to the default.


    **2. Floating Terminal for Scratchpad (Recommended):**

    A floating terminal provides a clearer visual separation.  This is generally a better user experience:

    ```swayconfig
    for_window [app_id="Alacritty", scratchpad_state=visible] {
        floating enable
        move position center
        resize set width 800 px height 400 px  # Adjust size as needed
        border pixel 5
        border_color #bf4040 # Or any color you prefer
    }

    for_window [app_id="Alacritty", scratchpad_state=hidden] {
        floating disable # Important to disable floating when hidden
    }
    ```

    This makes the scratchpad terminal float in the center, with a specific size and border, clearly distinguishing it from your tiled main terminal window. Remember to disable floating when the scratchpad is hidden to avoid conflicts with your tiling layout.

    **3. Different Terminal Instance for Scratchpad:**

    While slightly less convenient, you could launch a separate terminal instance specifically for scratchpad use.  This gives you complete control over its appearance and configuration.  You would then assign this specific instance to the scratchpad in your Sway config.  For example:

    ```swayconfig
    bindsym $mod+Shift+Return exec alacritty --class scratchpad-terminal  # Launch and assign to scratchpad
    assign [class="scratchpad-terminal"] scratchpad

    for_window [class="scratchpad-terminal"] {
       # Customization for scratchpad terminal
       set $term_border pixel 1
       set $term_border_color #d8dee9 # Example color
    }

    for_window [app_id="Alacritty"] {  # Your main terminal
        set $term_border pixel 1
        set $term_border_color #2e3440
    }
    ```

    This approach uses the `--class` argument when launching Alacritty (or a similar option for your terminal) to mark it as the scratchpad terminal, which Sway can then identify and manage separately.

    **Which Approach is Best?**

    The **floating terminal (option 2)** is generally the most user-friendly and provides the clearest visual distinction. Option 1 (border change) is simpler but might be less noticeable. Option 3 (separate instance) offers maximum customization but requires managing a separate terminal process.  Choose the method that best fits your workflow.


    Remember to reload your Sway config after making changes (`swaymsg reload`).  Experiment with different border colors, sizes, and floating window positions to find the setup that works best for you.

    You are absolutely correct. `scratchpad_state=visible` is *not* a valid Sway property.  I apologize for the error in my previous response.

    The correct way to achieve the desired behavior is to use the `__focused` pseudo-property in combination with the criteria for the scratchpad.  This will apply the styling only when the scratchpad is visible *and* the terminal within it has focus.

    Here's the corrected configuration for both the border and floating examples:

    **1. Distinct Border for Scratchpad Terminals (Corrected):**

    ```swayconfig
    for_window [app_id="Alacritty"] {
        set $term_border pixel 1
        set $term_border_color #2e3440
    }

    for_window [app_id="Alacritty", __focused] {  // <-- Corrected line
        set $term_border pixel 5
        set $term_border_color #bf4040
    }
    # No need for a separate hidden state rule
    ```

    **Explanation:**  The `__focused` criteria ensures the thicker border is applied only when the Alacritty window inside the scratchpad has focus.  When you switch to another workspace or another window, even if the scratchpad is still "visible" (i.e., not hidden), the border will revert to the default.



    **2. Floating Terminal for Scratchpad (Corrected):**

    ```swayconfig
    for_window [app_id="Alacritty", __focused] {  // <-- Corrected line
        floating enable
        move position center
        resize set width 800 px height 400 px
        border pixel 5
        border_color #bf4040
    }
    # Remove floating disable rule (unnecessary and potentially problematic)

    ```

    **Explanation:**  Similar to the border example, `__focused` ensures that the floating properties are only applied when the scratchpad terminal is active. You don't need to explicitly disable floating; Sway handles that automatically when the terminal loses focus.  In fact, a `floating disable` rule in this context could interfere with proper tiling behavior when the terminal is not in the scratchpad.



    **Important Considerations:**

    * **Focus:** These corrected configurations rely on the terminal *having focus*. If you just bring the scratchpad on top without focusing on the terminal window inside it, the changes won't apply.
    * **`app_id` vs. `class`:**  Use `app_id` if possible, as it's more reliable than `class`.  You can get your terminal's `app_id` with `swaymsg -t get_tree`.
    * **Reload Sway Config:**  After making changes to your Sway config, remember to reload it using `swaymsg reload`.


    I apologize again for the initial mistake.  This corrected version should work as intended. Let me know if you have any further questions.

- role: assistant
  content: |-
    The Hyprland setting `col.active_border = $mauve $flamingo 90deg` creates a gradient border for active windows.  Sway doesn't have *direct* support for gradient borders. You can achieve a similar visual effect, but it requires a more involved workaround using a separate program to draw a decorative border around windows.

    Here's a breakdown and a suggested approach:

    **Why Sway Doesn't Directly Support Gradient Borders:**

    Sway (and wlroots-based compositors in general) have a more minimalist approach to decorations.  They primarily manage simple, solid-color borders.  Features like gradients or rounded corners are often delegated to external programs.

    **Workaround using `grim` and ` slurp` (for screenshots) and `imagemagick` (for image manipulation):**

    This approach involves capturing a screenshot of the window, adding a gradient border using image manipulation, and then setting the resulting image as the window's background.  It's not a perfect solution, but it can approximate the desired effect.

    1. **Install necessary tools:**

    ```bash
    sudo apt install grim slurp imagemagick
    ```

    2. **Create a script (e.g., `gradient_border.sh`):**

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash

    window_id="$1"
    mauve="#cba6f7"  # Replace with your desired colors
    flamingo="#f2cdcd"
    angle="90"


    grim -g "$(slurp -w "$window_id")" - | convert - \
        \( +clone -bordercolor "$mauve" -border 10  -bordercolor "$flamingo" -border 10 -rotate "$angle" \) \
        -gravity center -composite - \
        png:- | swaybg -m fill -i - "$window_id"

    ```

    3. **Make the script executable:**

    ```bash
    chmod +x gradient_border.sh
    ```

    4. **In your Sway config:**

    ```swayconfig
    for_window [__focused] exec gradient_border.sh %i
    ```


    **Explanation:**

    * **`grim` and `slurp`:** `slurp` gets the geometry of the focused window and `grim` takes a screenshot of that area.
    * **`convert` (ImageMagick):** This is where the magic happens.  The command creates a clone of the screenshot, adds a double border (mauve and flamingo), rotates it, and composites it with the original screenshot.  The output is a PNG image.
    * **`swaybg`:** This sets the generated PNG image as the window's background, creating the appearance of a gradient border. The `-m fill` option ensures the image covers the entire window area.
    * **`%i`:** In the Sway config, `%i` represents the window ID, which is passed as an argument to the script.

    **Limitations:**

    * **Performance:** This method can be resource-intensive, especially for frequently changing window focus.
    * **Static Border:** The border is generated based on the initial window size and won't dynamically adjust if the window is resized.
    * **Transparency:**  Handling transparency with this method can be tricky.

    **Alternative (Simpler, Less Accurate):**

    For a simpler but less accurate approach, you can set two borders of different colors:

    ```swayconfig
    for_window [__focused] {
        border pixel 10
        border_color $mauve  # Your mauve color
        client.focused_inactive_border_color $flamingo  //Inner border
    }
    ```

    This gives a layered border effect, but it won't be a true gradient.


    The `grim`/`convert`/`swaybg` method provides the closest approximation to a gradient border in Sway, but be aware of its limitations. Choose the approach that best balances visual appeal and performance for your needs.

    Give me a solid color approximation in sway for the previous gradient color in hyprland if the colors are defined as ```set $flamingo #f2cdcd
    set $mauve #cba6f7
    ```
- role: assistant
  content: |-
    For a solid color approximation of the Hyprland gradient `col.active_border = $mauve $flamingo 90deg`, you'll want a color that visually sits "in between" `$mauve` and `$flamingo`.  A good approach is to average the RGB values of the two colors.

    Let's break down the colors:

    * **`$flamingo #f2cdcd`:**
        * Red: `f2` (hex) = 242 (decimal)
        * Green: `cd` (hex) = 205 (decimal)
        * Blue: `cd` (hex) = 205 (decimal)

    * **`$mauve #cba6f7`:**
        * Red: `cb` (hex) = 203 (decimal)
        * Green: `a6` (hex) = 166 (decimal)
        * Blue: `f7` (hex) = 247 (decimal)

    Now, let's average the RGB components:

    * **Average Red:** (242 + 203) / 2 = 445 / 2 = 222.5  (Let's round to 223)
    * **Average Green:** (205 + 166) / 2 = 371 / 2 = 185.5  (Let's round to 186)
    * **Average Blue:** (205 + 247) / 2 = 452 / 2 = 226

    Now convert these averaged RGB values back to hex:

    * Red: 223 (decimal) = `df` (hex)
    * Green: 186 (decimal) = `ba` (hex)
    * Blue: 226 (decimal) = `e2` (hex)

    So, the approximate solid color in hex is **`#dfbae2`**.

    Here's how you would use it in your Sway config:

    ```swayconfig
    set $flamingo #f2cdcd
    set $mauve #cba6f7
    set $approx_gradient_color #dfbae2

    for_window [__focused] {
        border pixel 2  # Or your preferred border width
        client.focused_border_color $approx_gradient_color
    }
    ```

    **Explanation:**

    * **`set $approx_gradient_color #dfbae2`**:  This line defines a new variable `$approx_gradient_color` and sets it to the calculated hex color.
    * **`for_window [__focused] { ... }`**: This applies the following settings only to focused windows.
    * **`border pixel 2`**:  Sets a border width of 2 pixels (adjust as needed).
    * **`client.focused_border_color $approx_gradient_color`**: This is the key line. It sets the border color for focused windows to our calculated `$approx_gradient_color`.

    **How good is this approximation?**

    This solid color approximation will give you a single, consistent border color that is visually "between" `$mauve` and `$flamingo`. It won't have the gradient effect, but it will likely be a reasonable representation of the overall color impression you get from the gradient.

    **To make it slightly closer (optional):**

    Depending on how you perceive the gradient, you might slightly adjust the averaged color. For example:

    * If you feel the gradient leans more towards `$mauve`, you could slightly darken or shift the average color closer to `$mauve`.
    * If you feel it leans more towards `$flamingo`, you could lighten or shift it closer to `$flamingo`.

    However, for a simple and quick approximation, `#dfbae2` is a good starting point.  Just reload your Sway config (`swaymsg reload`) to apply the changes.
